                One of the most famous historical sites in India, the Taj Mahal
                of Agra dates back to the 17th century. It was built by Shah
                Jahan, the Mughal emperor, in the memory of Mumtaz Mahal, his
                third wife. It is also the abode of the tomb of Shah Jahan
                himself.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Taj Mahal has intricate carvings and is made entirely of
                white marble, on the southern banks of the Yamuna River. It is
                also one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

                Built in the Dravidian style of architecture, the Meenakshi
                Amman Temple ranks as one of the most beautiful ancient places
                in India. Built in the early 17th century, the temple is located
                on the southern banks of the Vaigai river in Madurai, Tamil
                Nadu. Also known as the Sri Meenakshi Temple, this temple is
                primarily dedicated to Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most striking part of the temple, however, is that both the
                god and goddess are worshipped together here. From minute
                details, art pieces in the pillars and walls, to 14 gateway
                towers called gopurams, and more, you can see it all at the
                Meenakshi Amman Temple.

                A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Elephanta Caves, located on
                the Gharapuri Island around 11 kilometres from Mumbai, is
                another one of the top historical places in India. Considered to
                be one of the most beautiful specimens of rock-cut art and
                architecture, dating back to the medieval times, these caves
                today are merely the remnants of what used to be elaborate
                artworks.

                The caves are accessible by a ferry ride from the Gateway of
                India in Mumbai and are home to cave temples that date back from
                the 5th to 7th centuries.
